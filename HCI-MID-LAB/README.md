# PolyLine Editor

Live demo: https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/polyline-editor/

## My Role
Implementation & Deployment (Phase 4)

## Features Implemented
- Draw polylines by clicking (B to begin)
- Delete points (D) — reconnects adjacent vertices
- Move/drag points (M)
- Refresh canvas (R)
- Quit/clear (Q or X)
- Insert point on a segment (I) [extension]
- Save to / Load from JSON file [extension]
- Grid snapping (10px) [extension]
- Sidebar with polyline list and live stats
- Keyboard shortcuts for all actions
- Up to 100 polylines supported

## Tech Stack
- Vanilla HTML5 + Canvas API + JavaScript
- No dependencies
- Deployed via GitHub Pages

## Challenges & Confusions
- Handling nearest-point detection efficiently across 100 polylines
- Segment projection math for the Insert feature
- Canvas resize handling without losing drawn state
- Coordinating with teammates on what the UI should expose
